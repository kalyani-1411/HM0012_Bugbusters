## Introduction:
  A complete website for pregnant women to ensure their safety and good health....

  A platform which is informative about pregnancy, can assist you and guide you fight
  against any kind of violence and where women can ask queries directly from doctors,
  NGOs is hard to find.
  Pregnant women everytime cannot go to doctors to take consult for small abnormalities
  or to take tips or solve their queries, there is not any seperate platform made for that
  purpose.

  It is fascinating for pregnant ladies to feel informative, entertained, assisted, guided, feel protected
  both mentally and physically at the same platform. It will keep them happy and will provide the
  feeling of safety.

  What better could be to keep pregnant women lively and make them feel safe. A seperate platform for
  them to ensure their safety and well being completely is itself a different approach to women safety.
